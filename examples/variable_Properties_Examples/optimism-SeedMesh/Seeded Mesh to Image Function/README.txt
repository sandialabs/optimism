********** Seeded Mesh to Image Function **********

The mesh_2_Image_* codes convert a seeded exodus files to a grayscale image. This should be more useful once we start to try to print some of these "optimized" material property meshes. Many different settings are available for editing, such build plate size in mm and pixels, location on build plate of the mesh, and the range of values to be expected for the properties and grayscale conversion (i.e. density from 0-1, grayscale from 50-255).

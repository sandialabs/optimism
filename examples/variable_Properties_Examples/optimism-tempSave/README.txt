This folder is used to store temporary files that need to be edited without changing the original file accidentally. 

The HyperViscoelastic_VariableProps.py file is saved here temporarily to ensure that the new branch to be checked out doesn't delete the changes made. It shouldn't be possible, but it would be unfortunate to lose this script, as it does work for current efforts.

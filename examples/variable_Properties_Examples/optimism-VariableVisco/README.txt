********** Variable ViscoElastic README **********

This variable viscoelastic project tests the application of the variable viscoelastic material model. The script takes in a seeded mesh (seeded with a density value between 0-1) which is used to calculate the viscoelastic properties for each element. The simulation is a simple displacement controlled compression, and while the B.C. could be edited to allow for traction controlled compression, the main purpose was to ensure the applicability of the viscoelastic material model.

This project utilizes the behaviors of shape memory polymers with the property optimization process. A random assignment of temperature dependent properties can be altered to affect a geometry's response to temperature and load cycling.

The main purpose of this code is to utilize the ability to randomly assign material properties. This is mainly done the final block (__main__), and the "key" needs to be changed to differ the pseudo-random values.

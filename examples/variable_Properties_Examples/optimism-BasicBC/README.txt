*********** Basic_BC README **********

This folder contains two different boundary conditions, traction and displacement. Both codes require a mesh that has properties assigned to the elements, otherwise a density value can be assigned uniformally. The current material models (03/25/25) require a density value, between 0 and 1, which is then used to calculate the material properties of each element. The basic boundaries of properties possible for a given density must be altered in the actual material property module. Current material property models do not have ideal material properties, as the calculations from density to degree of cure to material properties are not confirmed yet. While the codes currently only apply a displacement or a load, it is possible to add in a second or more steps to the simulation, such as a second stage of loading, or unloading.

ElementPropertyOptimization_Displacement uses displacement control to compress or stretch a mesh. All the boundary conditions can be altered to change direction of displacement, face that is displaced, or maximum displacement. There are two output files from this code, an exodus file and a .npz file. The exodus file has the displacement and strain energy density of each step and can be used to visualize the displacement. The .npz file saves the force and displacement responses of the specified sideset. 

MaterialPropertyOptimization_Traction uses force control to compress or stretch a mesh. All the boundary conditions can be altered to change direction of the applied load, face that is loaded, or maximum force. There are two kinds of output files from this code, an .vtk and several .npz files. The .vtk file saves the strain energy density, displacement, and density values (noted as the element_property_field). The .npz file saves the force and displacement of the specified sideset.
